# good-readme

I used npm install -Y to download all the necessary node modules and package-Json.

I used inquirer to set up my questions which would be answered by the user after being prompted in the terminal with node. I then used axios asyncronously to take the input of the username an find that users repo. With that information I was than able to return the users avatar. 

The remaining questions would then be answered by the user in order to build the rest of the read me. I used generateMarkdown in order to know exactly were my users answers would be placed inside the README.MD. I used F.S. function to actually have those answers appear on the README.

I had the user choose the name of his README.MD
